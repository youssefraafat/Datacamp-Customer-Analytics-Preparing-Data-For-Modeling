![Data scientists working on a dashboard.](dashboard-image.png)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and optimizing a large customer dataset from a fictional online education platform, Radar DataCamp. The dataset, `customer_data.csv`, contains anonymized student details, including their course completion status. The objective is to streamline data storage for quicker model predictions.

## Key Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gain insights into the dataset.
2. **Optimizing Column Types**: Reduce memory consumption.
3. **Simplifying Categorical Variables**: Eliminate redundant categories.
4. **Reordering Columns**: Align with the original dataset structure.
5. **Filtering Data**: Select students based on experience and company size.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

## Dataset Information
- `customer_data.csv` includes columns like `student_id`, `city`, `gender`, `course_completion`, `education_level`, `experience`, and `company_size`.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pandas`).
3. Execute the Python script to clean and optimize the dataset.

## Conclusion
Optimizing the storage of large datasets is essential for enabling faster model predictions. This project demonstrates a method for efficiently managing a customer dataset, providing a foundation for future applications.
